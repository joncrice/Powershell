Updates made to WebShere to support move of the Maximo database server.

Location for deployed Enterprise Archives:
D:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\ctgAppSrv01\installedApps\
Three EARs deployed: 
	EZDash.ear
	ezmaxmobile.ear
	MAXIMO.ear
	
In the D:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\ctgAppSrv01\installedApps\ctgCell01\MAXIMO.ear there is a properties.jar file

The following steps were performed to updated the configuration to point to FQDN of the database server.
1) Backed up the entire MAXIMO.ear to (d:\Backup)
2) Copied the properties.jar file to a new location (d:\temp)
3) Extracted files in the properties.jar file withj 7zip.
4) Edited the maximo.properties file to use the host name of the database server rather than the IP address.
	FROM: mxe.db.url=jdbc:inetdae7a:10.250.132.108:1433?database=MAXTEST&language=us_english&nowarnings=true&mars=false
	TO:   mxe.db.url=jdbc:inetdae7a:TFTMVMMAXDB.tufts.ad.tufts.edu:1433?database=MAXTEST&language=us_english&nowarnings=true&mars=false
5) Opened the properties.jar file with 7Zip and updated the maximo.properies file with the updated file.
6) Copied the the updated properties.jar file in the deployed 
	
Notes: 
If this gets re-deployed we need to be aware that there may be left-over configuration items still pointing to the the old address of the 
This required and update of the firewall rules (INC0448290) to allow the app server to connect to the IP of the new database server.
This IBM support document helped point in the correct direction to take for updating the properties.jar file: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV22171
The connection information is also in D:\ibm\SMP\maximo\applications\maximo\properties\maximo.properties but this does not effect the runtime of the deployed app.
